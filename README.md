If you want to view, download these PDF's. Github is rendering them in a way which looks like I use bold and/or italic for every other word - must be some aliasing going on.

These are PDFs: brief study guides on transistors, amplifier design, Q-points, transconductance, and more. Bipolar junction transistors, MOSFETs, Darlington Transistors. 

For a great resource on this information, see:
"Electronics" by Dr. Allan Hambley
"Hyperphysics website" by Dr. Rod Nave of Georgia Tech
